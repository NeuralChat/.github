# NeuralChat 🧠🗨️

## 📖 About the Project

NeuralChat is an innovative online conversation system where users connect using their mobile devices.

However, we stand out from every other chat you've ever known. Our platform leverages the power of Artificial Intelligence to enhance the user experience and provide a variety of features.

We're not just about conversation; we're about optimization and support. We utilize AI technology to automate tasks and provide assistance to our users, thereby improving the efficiency and quality of our service.

## 🏗️ System Construction

Our system was built in an optimized manner, implementing three separate services:

1. **Django server**: This is the main server that users connect to.
2. **PostgreSQL database**: The Django server constantly interacts with this database.
3. **AI service**: This is disconnected from the Django server. It collects data from the database, processes it constantly, and feeds back into the database with statistics and data.
